    config MCP2518_ASSERT
        bool "Enable assertions"
        default y
        help
            If this is set, assertion checks are enabled and failed assertions will
            crash the application.
    config MCP2518_DEBUG_PRINT
        bool "Enable debug prints"
        default n
        help
            Enables rather verbose printing that may be useful for debugging, e.g.
            printing on every register read and write

    config MCP2518_CRC_ENABLE
        bool "Enable CRC check on register reads and writes"
        default n
        help
            If enabled, all register reads and writes will use the *_CRC opcodes
            and compare the locally calculated CRC with one read from the MCP2518

    config MCP2518_ATTR
        bool "Place fast path functions in IRAM"
        default n
        help
            Places "fast path" functions, i.e. sending and receiving messages, into
            IRAM rather than flash memory, thus decreasing the likelihood of experencing
            instruction cache misses
